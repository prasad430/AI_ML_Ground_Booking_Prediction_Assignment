# 🏟️ Ground Booking Prediction using AI/ML

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict ground bookings based on historical data. It is aimed at helping sports venues or institutions forecast future demand, allocate resources effectively, and avoid overbooking.

## 📌 Project Objective

- To analyze past ground booking data
- To build a predictive model that can forecast future bookings
- To understand patterns and trends in ground usage

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn, matplotlib

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Training**
5. **Model Evaluation**
6. **Prediction**

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest
- Other ML algorithms (based on notebook content)

## 📁 Files Included

- `AI_ML_Ground_Booking_Prediction_Assignments.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code, visualizations, and model training.
